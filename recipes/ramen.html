    <h3>BROTH</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp toasted or untoasted sesame oil*</li>
        <li>2 small knobs ginger</li>
        <li>10 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 large onion </li>
        <li>5 Tbsp yellow or green curry paste</li>
        <li>8 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>4 cups light coconut milk</li>
        <li>2-4 Tbsp coconut sugar (optional // more to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric (optional // for color and more curry flavor)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp white or yellow miso paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>FOR SERVING</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4-6 cups noodles of choice (i.e. spiralized zucchini squash, cooked ramen noodles*, or cooked brown rice noodles)</li>
        <li>4 whole portobello mushrooms (optional // stems removed, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces // sautéed in 1 Tbsp sesame oil + 1 Tbsp tamari + 1 tsp maple syrup)</li>
        <li>Fresh green onion (optional // chopped)</li>
        <li>Sriracha or chili garlic sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add oil, garlic, ginger, and onion. Sauté, stirring occasionally for 5-8 minutes or until the onion has developed a slight sear (browned edges).</li>
        <li>Add curry paste and sauté for 1-2 minutes more, stirring frequently. Then add vegetable broth and coconut milk and stir to deglaze the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1 hour, up to 2-3, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.</li>
        <li>Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding coconut sugar for a little sweetness, turmeric for more intense curry flavor, or more sesame oil for nuttiness.</li>
        <li>About 10 minutes before serving, prepare any desired toppings/sides, such as noodles, sautéed portobello mushrooms, or green onion (optional).</li>
        <li>Just before serving, scoop out 1/2 cup of the broth and whisk in the miso paste. Once fully dissolved, add back to the pot and turn off the heat. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Either strain broth through a fine mesh strainer (discarding onions, garlic, and ginger or adding back to the soup) or ladle out the broth and leave the onions, garlic, and ginger behind.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide noodles of choice between serving bowls. Top with broth and desired toppings. Serve with chili garlic sauce or sriracha for added heat.</li>
        <li>Best when fresh, though the broth can be stored (separate from sides/toppings) in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>*You can sub sesame oil for coconut, but the sesame adds a nice rich nutty flavor to the ramen that I prefer.
        *Ramen is a popular Japanese dish the originates from China and the addition of coconut milk and curry paste is Thai-inspired.
        *Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated using brown rice noodles and mushrooms with no additional toppings.
        *If using ramen noodles, this recipe would not be gluten free.
